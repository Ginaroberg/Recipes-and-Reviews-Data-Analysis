### by William Kam and Gina Roberg

This was a research project for a course on the Practice and Application of Data Science at UCSD.  The data used was scraped from food.com.  This is a report of our findings.

## Introduction
Provide an introduction to your dataset, and clearly state the one question your analysis is centered around. Why should readers of your website care about the dataset and your question specifically? Report the number of rows in the dataset, the names of the columns that are relevant to your question, and descriptions of those relevant columns.

The dataset we were provided consisted of recipes and ratings for the provided recipes, originally scraped from food.com.  With this data, our analysis was centered around the question of "What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?"  To answer this question, we utilized our dataset.
